Background:
  - Title: The Constellar Confederation
    Type: Historical
    Clearance: C0
    Content: |
      The Constellar Confederation is an alliance of Constellations bound by mutual defense and shared prosperity. It forbids conquest and unprovoked aggression.
      Origins:
      In 2080 the Boötes Constellation revolted against the Regium Empire. By 2084 they secured independence and captured the Sunrise Crown, destabilizing Regium rule.
      Draco Alliance:
      The Draco Free Constellation ended its isolation and allied with the Boötes, combining dragon might with revolutionary fervor.
      Collapse of Regium:
      In 2090 the Heracles Constellation defected to the Boötes Alliance. Regium steadily lost its subject states.
      Founding:
      The Arcturus Accords of 2172 created the Confederation. The Regium Empire dissolved in 2200.
      Structure:
      Membership is voluntary. Governance lies with the Naval Command Council, two representatives per member. Chairmanship rotates every two years.
      Legacy:
      Draco, Boötes, and Hercules constellations remain its strongest pillars, standing for peace and collective defense.
  - Title: Decline of the Regium Empire
    Type: Lore
    Clearance: C0
    Content: |
      The Regium Empire declined over more than a century. Its fall came not by conquest but by the defection of its own Constellations.
      Boötes Revolt:
      In 2080 the Boötes Constellation rose in rebellion. In 2084 they seized the Sunrise Crown, shaking imperial legitimacy.
      Draco Entry:
      Draco allies with Boötes, transforming rebellion into a liberation war.
      Heracles Defection:
      In 2090 the Heracles Constellation abandoned Regium, taking with it industry and armies. Regium’s strength collapsed.
      Unraveling:
      Through the 22nd century C.A.E. Constellations defected steadily. In 2172 the Arcturus Accords established the Confederation. By 2200 the Empire was gone, replaced by the diminished Regium Regency.
      Legacy:
      The Confederation proved unity could be forged without empire. The fall of Regium is remembered as the rise of confederated peace.
